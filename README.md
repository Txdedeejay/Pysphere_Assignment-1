4. Write Your Python Script
Inside the cloned folder, create a Python file (e.g., ohms_law.py) with code that:
Asks the user to input values for current (I) and resistance (R)


Calculates and prints the voltage (V) using V = I * R


Example behavior:
Enter the current (in A): 3
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 10
The voltage is: 30 volts

5. Push Your Code to GitHub
In your terminal:
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution for Ohm's Law assignment"
git push
